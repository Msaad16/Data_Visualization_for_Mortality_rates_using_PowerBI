## Data Visualization for Mortality rates using Power BI

This project uses data from World Health Organization's "Communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions" mortality database and seeks to identify the mortality rate trends for 60 countries from 1989 to 2015. The visualization of the data begins at a global level after which we separate it into 5 global regions. We then try to see how the trends behave between genders and different age groups. 

The data preparation for this project has been done using MS Excel. 

The original data for this project can be found on:
